TEST_ENTRY = """March 15, 2014

Today feels like I'm walking through a maze of mirrors. Every decision reflects back at me, distorted and confusing. The project deadline is looming over me like a storm cloud, dark and threatening. I'm excited about the potential impact, but my stomach is in knots every time I think about presenting to the board.

Sarah stopped by my desk to offer help, which was like a ray of sunshine breaking through the clouds. It's amazing how she always knows when I'm drowning in work. Bob, on the other hand, keeps adding more to my plate - it's like he's stacking bricks on a drowning person.

I spent my lunch break alone in the park, watching leaves dance in the wind. Sometimes I feel like those leaves - carried wherever the wind takes me. Part of me craves more control, wants to be the wind rather than the leaf. But another part just wants to curl up in my apartment and hide from everything.

My anxiety is through the roof, but there's also this undercurrent of determination. Like a river cutting through rock - slow but unstoppable. I know I'll get through this phase, just like all the others. Each challenge is like climbing another mountain, and the view from the top might be worth all this struggle.

Time to stop writing and get back to work. My mind feels clearer now, like fog burning off in morning sun.
